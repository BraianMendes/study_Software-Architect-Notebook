# SOLID

SOLID is a set of principles applied to object-oriented design (OOD) to create maintainable, understandable, and flexible code, while avoiding code smells and defects. The principles are:

* Single Responsibility
* Open/Closed
* Liskov Substitution
* Interface Segregation
* Dependency Inversion

## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll be discussing the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

First, we'll start by exploring the reasons they came about and why we should consider them when designing software. Then we'll outline each principle alongside some example code.
